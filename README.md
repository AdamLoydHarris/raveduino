# raveduino
Arduino LED array project for fun personal festival visuals

## ideas / todos:
- move function to plot x, y coordinates to a separate file so we can import it
- add more detail to the pyramid stage sketch
- make the twinkle sketch prettier e.g. can we fade the lights in/out, and add delays to when they light up
- try wire up the circuit with a button to change setting
